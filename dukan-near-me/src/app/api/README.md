# Backend Details

This document provides an overview of how frontend developers can interact with the backend authentication system.

## **Backend Overview**
The backend is built using **Next.js** with **NextAuth.js** for authentication. It handles user authentication via **credentials (email & password)** and manages sessions using **JWT tokens**.

## **Authentication Endpoints**
Since authentication is managed by **NextAuth.js**, there are no custom API endpoints for login, signup, or logout. Instead, use the built-in NextAuth methods in the frontend.

### ðŸ“Œ **Socket.IO Integration**
The backend uses **Socket.IO** with **Redis** for real-time messaging. Below are the key events handled by the WebSocket server:

#### ðŸ”¹ **Socket Events**
| Event Name        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `connection`     | When a user connects to the WebSocket server |
| `register`       | Registers a user by storing their socket ID in Redis |
| `sendMessage`    | Sends a message from a user to an institution |
| `disconnect`     | Removes the user from Redis when they disconnect |

#### ðŸ”¹ **Redis Pub/Sub**
- **Publisher:** Publishes messages to Redis on the `chat` channel.
- **Subscriber:** Listens for new messages and forwards them to the respective recipient.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Message Handling**
1. When a user sends a message via `sendMessage`, it is published to Redis.
2. The subscriber listens for new messages and stores them in MongoDB via Prisma.
3. If the receiver is online, the message is delivered instantly.
4. If the receiver is offline, the message remains in the database for later retrieval.

ðŸš€ **Socket.IO is running on port `3001` with CORS enabled (`*`).**
